SPAM SMS DETECTION This is a machine learning project to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. I used TF-IDF and word embeddings to extract features from the text, and experimented with different classifiers to find the best one. The data is from the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset] from Kaggle.
