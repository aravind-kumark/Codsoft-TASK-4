Spam SMS Detection
Overview

This is a Machine Learning project aimed at classifying SMS messages as spam or legitimate (ham). The project utilizes TF-IDF and word embeddings for feature extraction and experiments with different classifiers to determine the best performing model.

Features

Text Cleaning: Removing punctuation, stopwords, and special characters.

Tokenization: Splitting text into words.

Lemmatization: Converting words to their base form.

Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF and Word Embeddings.

Classification Models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Deep Learning (LSTM, CNN).

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
